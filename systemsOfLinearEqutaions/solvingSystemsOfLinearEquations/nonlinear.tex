\begin{example}
  Suppose we desire the simultaneous solutions of the two equations,
  \begin{align*}
    x^2+y^2&=1,\\
    -x+\sqrt{3}y&=0.
  \end{align*}
  
  You can check by substitution that $x=\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2},\;y=\tfrac{1}{2}$ and $x=-\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2},\;y=-\tfrac{1}{2}$ are both solutions.

  \begin{question}
    Are there any other solutions?
    \begin{multipleChoice}
      \choice[correct]{No}
      \choice{Yes}
    \end{multipleChoice}
  \end{question}
    
  \begin{question}
    We need to also convince ourselves that these are the
    \textit{only} solutions.  To see this, plot each equation on the
    $xy$-plane, which means to plot $(x,\,y)$ pairs that make an
    individual equation true.  In this case we get a circle centered
    at the origin with radius 1 and a straight line through the origin
    with slope $\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$.  The intersections of these two
    curves are our desired simultaneous solutions, and so we believe
    from our plot that the two solutions we know already are indeed
    the only ones.  We like to write solutions as sets, so in this
    case we write the set of solutions as
    \[
      S=\set{\left(\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2},\,\answer{\frac{1}{2}}\right),\,\left(-\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2},\,-\tfrac{1}{2}\right)}
    \]
  \end{question}

  \begin{question}
    This example yielded exactly two solutions, but earlier we asserted that a system of linear equations has either zero, one, or infinitely many solutions.

    The second equation is $-x+\sqrt{3}y=0$ so it is already in our desired form.  Is this system of equations a system of \textit{linear} equations?
    \begin{multipleChoice}
      \choice{Yes: we can write the first equation as $x \cdot x + y \cdot y = 1$.}
      \choice{correct}[No.]
    \end{multipleChoice}

    \begin{feedback}
      The above equations are not a linear system of equations because the coefficients are not fixed complex numbers.
    \end{feedback}
  \end{question}
\end{example}
