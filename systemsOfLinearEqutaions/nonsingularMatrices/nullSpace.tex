  The \wordChoice{\choice{nonsingular}\choice[correct]{singular}} matrix
  \[
    A = \begin{bmatrix}

      0 & 0 & 0

  The null space of $A$ is the set of solutions to the homogeneous
  system of equations $\homosystem{A}$; the null space consists of 
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{a single vector.}
    \choice[correct]{an infinite set of vectors.}
  \end{multipleChoice}

    \end{bmatrix},
  \]
  The null space of $B$ is the set of solutions to the homogeneous
  system of equations $\homosystem{B}$; the null space consists of 
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{a single vector.}
    \choice{an infinite set of vectors.}
  \end{multipleChoice}
\end{example}

These two examples illustrate the next theorem, which is another equivalence.

\begin{theorem}[Nonsingular Matrices have Trivial Null Spaces]
\label{theorem:NMTNS}

Suppose that $A$ is a square matrix.  Then $A$ is nonsingular if and only if the null space of $A$ is the set containing only the zero vector, i.e.,  $\nsp{A}=\set{\zerovector}$.

\begin{proof}
  The null space of a square \textit{matrix}, $A$, is equal to the set
  of solutions to the homogeneous \textit{system}, $\homosystem{A}$.
  A \textit{matrix} is nonsingular if and only if the set of solutions
  to the homogeneous \textit{system}, $\linearsystem{A}{\zerovector}$,
  has only a trivial solution.  These two observations may be chained
  together to construct the two proofs necessary for each half of this
  theorem.
\end{proof}
\end{theorem}

The next theorem pulls a lot of big ideas together, and it tells us
that we can learn much about solutions to a system of linear equations
with a square coefficient matrix by just examining a similar
homogeneous system.

\begin{theorem}[Nonsingular Matrices and Unique Solutions]
  \label{theorem:NMUS}
  Suppose that $A$ is a square matrix.  $A$ is a nonsingular matrix if
  and only if the system $\linearsystem{A}{\vect{b}}$ has a unique
  solution for every choice of the constant vector $\vect{b}$.

  \begin{proof}
    $(\Leftarrow)$ The hypothesis for this half of the proof is that
    the system $\linearsystem{A}{\vect{b}}$ has a unique solution for
    \textit{every} choice of the constant vector $\vect{b}$.  We will
    make a very specific choice for $\vect{b}$:
    $\vect{b}=\zerovector$.  Then we know that the system
    $\linearsystem{A}{\zerovector}$ has a unique solution.  But this
    is precisely the definition of what it means for $A$ to be
    nonsingular (\ref{definition:NM}).  That almost seems too easy!
    Notice that we have not used the full power of our hypothesis, but
    there is nothing that says we must use a hypothesis to its
    fullest.

    $(\Rightarrow)$ We assume that $A$ is nonsingular of size
    $n\times n$, so we know there is a sequence of row operations that
    will convert $A$ into the identity matrix $I_n$
    (\ref{theorem:NMRRI}).  Form the augmented matrix
    $A^\prime=\augmented{A}{\vect{b}}$ and apply this same sequence of
    row operations to $A^\prime$.  The result will be the matrix
    $B^\prime=\augmented{I_n}{\vect{c}}$, which is in reduced
    row-echelon form with $r=n$.  Then the augmented matrix $B^\prime$
    represents the (extremely simple) system of equations
    $x_i=\vectorentry{\vect{c}}{i}$, $1\leq i\leq n$.  The vector
    $\vect{c}$ is clearly a solution, so the system is consistent
    (\ref{definition:CS}).  With a consistent system, we use
    \ref{theorem:FVCS} to count free variables.  We find that there
    are $n-r=n-n=0$ free variables, and so we therefore know that the
    solution is unique.  (This half of the proof was suggested by Asa
    Scherer.)
\end{proof}
\end{theorem}

This theorem helps to explain part of our interest in nonsingular
matrices.  If a matrix is nonsingular, then no matter what vector of
constants we pair it with, using the matrix as the coefficient matrix
will \textit{always} yield a linear system of equations with a
solution, and the solution is unique.  To determine if a matrix has
this property (nonsingularity) it is enough to just solve one linear
system, the homogeneous system with the matrix as coefficient matrix
and the zero vector as the vector of constants (or any other vector of
constants, see <acroref type="exercise" acro="MM.T10" />).

Formulating the negation of the second part of this theorem is a good
exercise.  A singular matrix has the property that for \textit{some}
value of the vector $\vect{b}$, the system
$\linearsystem{A}{\vect{b}}$ does not have a unique solution (which
means that it has no solution or infinitely many solutions).  We will
be able to say more about this case later (see the discussion
following \ref{theorem:PSPHS}).

Square matrices that are nonsingular have a long list of interesting
properties, which we will start to catalog in the following,
recurring, theorem.  Of course, singular matrices will then have all
of the opposite properties.  The following theorem is a list of
equivalences.

\begin{theorem}[Nonsingular Matrix Equivalences, Round 1]
  Suppose that $A$ is a square matrix.  The following are equivalent.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $A$ is nonsingular.
  \item $A$ row-reduces to the identity matrix.
  \item The null space of $A$ contains only the zero vector, $\nsp{A}=\set{\zerovector}$.
  \item The linear system $\linearsystem{A}{\vect{b}}$ has a unique solution for every possible choice of $\vect{b}$.
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \begin{proof}
    The statement that $A$ is nonsingular is equivalent to each of the
    subsequent statements by, in turn, \ref{theorem:NMRRI},
    \ref{theorem:NMTNS} and \ref{theorem:NMUS}.  So the statement of
    this theorem is just a convenient way to organize all these
    results.
  \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\begin{warning}
  You may have wondered why we refer to a matrix as
  \textit{nonsingular} when it creates systems of equations with
  \textit{single} solutions (\ref{theorem:NMUS})!  I have wondered the
  same thing.  We will have an opportunity to address this later\ldots
  %when we get to \ref{theorem:SMZD}.  Can you wait that long?
\end{warning}
