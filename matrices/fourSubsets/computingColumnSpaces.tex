\begin{abstract}
  There are many methods for computing the column space of a matrix.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

We have three ways to build the column space of a matrix.  First, we
can use just the definition, \ref{definition:CSM}, and express the
column space as a span of the columns of the matrix.  A second
approach gives us the column space as the span of \textit{some} of the
columns of the matrix, and additionally, this set is linearly
independent (\ref{theorem:BCS}).  Finally, we can transpose the
matrix, row-reduce the transpose, kick out zero rows, and write the
remaining rows as column vectors.  \ref{theorem:CSRST} and
\ref{theorem:BRS} tell us that the resulting vectors are linearly
independent and their span is the column space of the original matrix.

We will now demonstrate a fourth method by way of a rather complicated
example.  Study this example carefully, but realize that its main
purpose is to motivate a theorem that simplifies much of the apparent
complexity.  So other than an instructive exercise or two, the
procedure we are about to describe will not be a usual approach to
computing a column space.

\begin{example}[Column space as null space]

Let us find the column space of the matrix $A$ below with a new approach.
\[
A=
\begin{bmatrix}
 10 & 0 & 3 & 8 & 7 \\
 -16 & -1 & -4 & -10 & -13 \\
 -6 & 1 & -3 & -6 & -6 \\
 0 & 2 & -2 & -3 & -2 \\
 3 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
 -1 & -1 & 1 & 1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\]

By \ref{theorem:CSCS} we know that the column vector $\vect{b}$ is in
the column space of $A$ if and only if the linear system
$\linearsystem{A}{\vect{b}}$ is
\wordChoice{\choice[correct]{consistent}\choice{inconsistent}}.  So
let us try to solve this system in full generality, using a vector of
variables for the vector of constants.  In other words, which vectors
$\vect{b}$ lead to consistent systems?  Begin by forming the augmented
matrix $\augmented{A}{\vect{b}}$ with a general version of $\vect{b}$,
\[
\augmented{A}{\vect{b}}=
\begin{bmatrix}
 10 & 0 & 3 & 8 & 7 & b_1 \\
 -16 & -1 & -4 & -10 & -13 & b_2 \\
 -6 & 1 & -3 & -6 & -6 & b_3 \\
 0 & 2 & -2 & -3 & -2 & b_4 \\
 3 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & b_ 5\\
 -1 & -1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & b_ 6
\end{bmatrix}
\]

To identify solutions we will bring this matrix to reduced row-echelon
form.  Despite the presence of variables in the last column, there is
nothing to stop us from doing this, except numerical computational
routines cannot be used, and even some of the symbolic algebra
routines do some unexpected maneuvers with this computation.  So do it
by hand.  Yes, it is a bit of work.  But worth it.  We'll still be
here when you get back.  Notice along the way that the row operations
are \textit{exactly} the same ones you would do if you were just
row-reducing the coefficient matrix alone, say in connection with a
homogeneous system of equations.  The column with the $b_i$ acts as a
sort of bookkeeping device.  There are many different possibilities
for the result, depending on what order you choose to perform the row
operations, but shortly we will all be on the same page.  If you want
to match our work right now, use row 5 to remove any occurrence of
$b_1$ from the other entries of the last column, and use row 6 to
remove any occurrence of $b_2$ from the last columns. We have:
\begin{align*}
\begin{bmatrix}
 \leading{1} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2 & b_3 - b_4 + 2 b_5 - b_6\\
 0 & \leading{1} & 0 & 0 & -3 & -2 b_3 + 3 b_4 - 3 b_5 + 3 b_6\\
 0 & 0 & \leading{1} & 0 & 1 & b_3 + b_4 + 3 b_5 + 3 b_6\\
 0 & 0 & 0 & \leading{1} & -2 & -2 b_3 + b_4 - 4 b_5\\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & b_1 + 3 b_3 - b_4 + 3 b_5 + b_6\\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & b_2 - 2 b_3 + b_4 + b_5 - b_6
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

Our goal is to identify those vectors $\vect{b}$ which make
$\linearsystem{A}{\vect{b}}$ consistent.  By \ref{theorem:RCLS} we
know that the consistent systems are precisely those without a pivot
column in the last column.  Are the expressions in the last column of
rows 5 and 6 equal to zero, or are they leading 1's?  The answer is:
maybe.  It depends on $\vect{b}$.  With a nonzero value for either of
these expressions, we would scale the row and produce a leading 1.  So
we get a consistent system, and $\vect{b}$ is in the column space, if
and only if these two expressions are both simultaneously zero.  In
other words, members of the column space of $A$ are exactly those
vectors $\vect{b}$ that satisfy
\begin{align*}
b_1 + 3 b_3 - b_4 + 3 b_5 + b_6 & = 0\\
b_2 - 2 b_3 + b_4 + b_5 - b_6 & = 0
\end{align*}

Hmmm.  Looks suspiciously like a homogeneous system of two equations
with six variables.  If you have been playing along (and we hope you
have) then you may have a slightly different system, but you should
have just two equations.  Form the coefficient matrix and row-reduce
(notice that the system above has a coefficient matrix that is already
in reduced row-echelon form).  We should all be together now with the
same matrix,
\[
L=
\begin{bmatrix}
 \leading{1} & 0 & 3 & -1 & 3 & 1 \\
 0 & \leading{1} & -2 & 1 & 1 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

So, $\csp{A}=\nsp{L}$ and we can apply \ref{theorem:BNS} to obtain a linearly independent set to use in a span construction,
\[
\csp{A}=\nsp{L}=\spn{\set{
\colvector{\answer{-3}\\\answer{2}\\1\\0\\0\\0},\,
\colvector{1\\-1\\0\\1\\0\\0},\,
\colvector{-3\\-1\\0\\0\\1\\0},\,
\colvector{-1\\1\\0\\0\\0\\1}
}}
\]

Whew!  As a postscript to this central example, you may wish to convince yourself that the four vectors above really are elements of the column space.  Do they create consistent systems with $A$ as coefficient matrix?  Can you recognize the constant vector in your description of these solution sets?
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Redux]
  OK, that was so much fun, let us do it again.  But simpler this
  time.  And we will all get the same results all the way through.

  Doing row operations by hand with variables can be a bit error
  prone, so let us see if we can improve the process some.  Rather
  than row-reduce a column vector $\vect{b}$ full of variables, let us
  write $\vect{b}=I_6\vect{b}$ and we will row-reduce the matrix $I_6$
  and when we finish row-reducing, \textit{then} we will compute the
  matrix-vector product.  You should first convince yourself that we
  can operate like this (this is the subject of a future homework
  exercise).

  Rather than augmenting $A$ with $\vect{b}$, we will instead augment
  it with $I_6$ (does this feel familiar?),
  \[
    M=
    \begin{bmatrix}
      10 & 0 & 3 & 8 & 7 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
      -16 & -1 & -4 & -10 & -13 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
      -6 & 1 & -3 & -6 & -6 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 2 & -2 & -3 & -2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
      3 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
      -1 & -1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
  \]

  We want to row-reduce the left-hand side of this matrix, but we will
  apply the same row operations to the right-hand side as well.  And
  once we get the left-hand side in reduced row-echelon form, we will
  continue on to put leading 1's in the final two rows, as well as
  making pivot columns that contain these two additional leading 1's.
  It is these additional row operations that will ensure that we all
  get to the same place, since the reduced row-echelon form is unique
  (\ref{theorem:RREFU}),
  \[
    N=
    \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 2 & -1 \\
      0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & -3 & 0 & 0 & -2 & 3 & -3 & 3 \\
      0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 \\
      0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -2 & 0 & 0 & -2 & 1 & -4 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 3 & -1 & 3 & 1 \\
      0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -2 & 1 & 1 & -1
    \end{bmatrix}
  \]

  We are after the final six columns of this matrix, which we will multiply by $\vect{b}$
  \[
    J=
    \begin{bmatrix}
      0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 2 & -1 \\
      0 & 0 & -2 & 3 & -3 & 3 \\
      0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 \\
      0 & 0 & -2 & 1 & -4 & 0 \\
      1 & 0 & 3 & -1 & 3 & 1 \\
      0 & 1 & -2 & 1 & 1 & -1
    \end{bmatrix}
  \]
  so
  \[
    J\vect{b}=
    \begin{bmatrix}
      0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 2 & -1 \\
      0 & 0 & -2 & 3 & -3 & 3 \\
      0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 \\
      0 & 0 & -2 & 1 & -4 & 0 \\
      1 & 0 & 3 & -1 & 3 & 1 \\
      0 & 1 & -2 & 1 & 1 & -1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \colvector{b_1\\b_2\\b_3\\b_4\\b_5\\b_6}
    =
    \colvector{
      b_3 - b_4 + 2 b_5 - b_6\\
      -2 b_3 + 3 b_4 - 3 b_5 + 3 b_6\\
      b_3 + b_4 + 3 b_5 + 3 b_6\\
      -2 b_3 + b_4 - 4 b_5\\
      b_1 + 3 b_3 - b_4 + 3 b_5 + b_6\\
      b_2 - 2 b_3 + b_4 + b_5 - b_6\\
    }
  \]

  So by applying the same row operations that row-reduce $A$ to the
  identity matrix (which we could do computationally once $I_6$ is
  placed alongside of $A$), we can then arrive at the result of
  row-reducing a column of symbols where the vector of constants
  usually resides.  Since the row-reduced version of $A$ has two zero
  rows, for a consistent system we require that
  \begin{align*}
    b_1 + \answer{3} b_3 - b_4 + 3 b_5 + b_6 & = 0\\
    b_2 + \answer{-2} b_3 + b_4 + b_5 - b_6 & = 0
  \end{align*}

  Now we are exactly back where we were on the first go-round.  Notice
  that we obtain the matrix $L$ as simply the last two rows and last
  six columns of $N$.
\end{example}

This motivates the remainder of this section, so it is worth careful
study.  We will see shortly that the matrix $L$ contains more
information about $A$ than just the column space.

Indeed, the final matrix that we row-reduced should look familiar in
most respects to the procedure we used to compute the inverse of a
nonsingular matrix.  We will now generalize that procedure to matrices
that are not necessarily nonsingular, or even square.
