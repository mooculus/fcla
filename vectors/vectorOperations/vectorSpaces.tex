  An example of a vector space is the result of collecting together
  all possible vectors of a fixed size.

Begin by recalling our definition of a column vector as an ordered
list of complex numbers, written vertically.  The collection of all
possible vectors of a fixed size is a commonly used set, so we start
with its definition.

\begin{definition}[Vector Space of Column Vectors]
The vector space $\complex{m}$ is the set of all column vectors of size $m$ with entries from the set of complex numbers, $\complexes$.

When a set similar to this is defined using only column vectors where
all the entries are from the real numbers, it is written as
${\mathbb R}^m$ and is known as \dfn{Euclidean $m$-space}.
\end{definition}

The term \dfn{vector} is used in a variety of different ways.  We have
defined it as an ordered list written vertically.  It could simply be
an ordered list of numbers, and perhaps written as
$\left\langle 2,\,3,\,-1,\,6\right\rangle$.  Or it could be
interpreted as a point in $m$ dimensions, such as
$\left(3,\,4,\,-2\right)$ representing a point in three dimensions
relative to $x$, $y$ and $z$ axes.  With an interpretation as a point,
we can construct an arrow from the origin to the point which is
consistent with the notion that a vector has direction and magnitude.

All of these ideas can be shown to be related and equivalent, so keep
that in mind as you connect the ideas of this course with ideas from
other disciplines.  For now, we will stick with the idea that a vector
is just a list of numbers, in some particular order.
